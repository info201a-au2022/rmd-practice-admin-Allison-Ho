## Covid Report
Looking at the data about COVID-19 from the New York Times, I am able to figure out the number of cases and number of deaths in the US at the national level from January 2020 to now. I will highlight that the total number of US cases is `r get_total_cases()`. And, the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. 

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)

I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
